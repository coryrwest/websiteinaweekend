                    The domain name is one of the most important aspects of your website. People hate typing in long domain names, so
                    having a short name is important. Also, people are familiar with the .com domain ending so you should try to stick
                    to that whenever possible. There are new domain endings being added all the time that cary some novelty or uniqueness,
                    such as .website, .attorney, or .club.

                    When choosing a domain name using your business or personal name is usually the easiest route. Unfortunately, many common
                    names are already taken. This just means we have to get creative. Using the box below you can search for available domain
                    names instantly and even receive some suggestions.
