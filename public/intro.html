                We built this guide because of a problem that we noticed among our clients. Many business owners
                know they need a website, or even a redesign of their current one, but they do not know where to go and
                who to trust to get it. They are perfectly willing to do it themselves, but can't spend days researching how.
                We provide you with an exact step by step blueprint to follow. All the unimportant decisions have been made
                for you. Where to host, where to get a domain, what platform to use. All you have to do is choose a domain
                name and fill in your content.
            </p>

                We tried to make this guide as easy as possible to follow for three reasons: First, your job is to run a business,
                not learn to code (unless your business is coding, in which case you probably shouldn't be here). Second, making
                the guide as easy as possible means that you should never get stuck and need help from someone else. Third, an
                easy guide is a quick guide. Our goal is to get you from start to finish in one weekend. If you already have a domain
                or hosting good for you, that just means you can finish that much faster.
