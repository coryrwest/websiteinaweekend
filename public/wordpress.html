                    We will be using WordPress as the platform for your new website. WordPress is a very popular, secure,
                    easy to use platform for building and maintaining websites. Because of its wide-spread use there are
                    tons of tutorials online about how to use it. For the purposes of this guide, we will teach you
                    everything you need to know.

                <h3>If you are using HostGator hosting</h3>
                <p>If you are using HostGator hosting then refer to the steps below.</p>
                <p>
                    In your HostGator control panel there should be a link in the <strong>Software/Services</strong>
                    section called Quick Install (see below). Click that link and you will be taken to the
                    <strong>Quick Install</strong> installer.</p>

                    Next, click on <strong>WordPress</strong> from the menu on the left.

                <p>
                    Next, click fill in the required information. We will be installing WordPress in the root directory
                    of your hosting, so leave the second box blank (the one with websiteinaweekend in it in the below
                    screenshot). Make sure that <strong>Enable Auto Upgrades</strong> is unchecked. Then click
                    <strong>Install Now</strong>.

                <p>
                    The installer will install WordPress on your hosting using the details you provided. When it is
                    finished it will give you a link and a username and password. Make sure you write these down as
                    we will need them later in the guide.
