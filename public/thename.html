                    The domain name is one of the most important aspects of your website. People hate typing in long domain names, so
                    having a short name is important. Also, people are familiar with the .com domain ending so you should try to stick
                    to that whenever possible. There are new domain endings being added all the time that cary some novelty or uniqueness,
                    such as .website, .attorney, or .club.
