                <strong>If you are redesigning your website then you already have hosting, you can continue to the next step if you know you
                    hosting information, otherwise you will probably have to buy new hosting. It will be more difficult for you to
                    find the necessary information to install your new website if you are using existing hosting.</strong>

                Choosing the right web hosting can be daunting with an industry as diverse as this. Luckily for you we have chosen
                for you. HostGator is one of our partners and offers very affordable hosting that is environmentally friendly and
                high-quality. We use their hosting exclusively in our company and have for years. Their support is quick to
                respond and top-notch.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have taken the liberty of selecting the most cost-effective solution for you.

                With our coupon code (websiteinaweekend) you will receive a 25% discount on the hosting package. It should already be
                applied when you click the button below. Make sure to input your domain name. If you chose a .com, .co, .biz, .info, .net, .org, or .me you can
                register the domain with HostGator. If you chose something else you will have to register the domain with NameCheap,
                <a href="#/namecheap">click here</a> to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The total cost of web hosting for two years, with our coupon code, should come out to around $100 with no extra options selected.

                <strong>IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE ON THIS PAGE, READ THIS.</strong> There are two options that are automatically
                selected when you add hosting to your cart. <em>Secure and Accelerate Your Site</em> is unnecessary. <em>Site Backup</em>
                is optional and can give you some piece of mind should something happen to your site. HostGator backs up your site
                automatically for their own purposes, but a restore is $15 and take about a day. <em>Site Backup</em> is faster
                and restores are free.

                Once you have purchased your hosting you will receive an email with all the details on how to install and administer
                your website. You will need this email before you continue to the next step.
